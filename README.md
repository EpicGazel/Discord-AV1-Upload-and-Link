This method is unnecessary now:
Simply upload the av1 to discord (mp4 or webm, mkv doesn't work)
Copy the link, change ".com" to ".xyz" and you can remove the tracking (everything after .mp4 or .webm):
https://cdn.discordapp.xyz/attachments/406338578755354625/1218784520061321336/Ladder-av1.mp4

Then use https://autocompressor.net/av1 and get:
https://autocompressor.net/av1?v=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.discordapp.xyz%2Fattachments%2F406338578755354625%2F1218784520061321336%2FLadder-av1.mp4&w=1280&h=720
(You can also remove the h&w as these don't seem absolutely necessary)
